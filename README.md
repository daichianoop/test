## Important Warnings

To maintain the organization and functionality of the project, please adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Folder Structure**: Always follow the specified folder structure. Place new components in the appropriate directories:
   - UI components should be placed in `src/components/ui/`.
   - General components should reside directly under `src/components/`.

2. **Naming Conventions**: Use clear and consistent naming conventions for files:
   - Use PascalCase for component filenames (`Button.js`, `Card.js`).
   - Ensure filenames reflect their purpose or function.

3. **Testing**: Write tests for newly added components in the corresponding format:
   - Place test files alongside their components, following the naming convention `ComponentName.test.js`.

4. **Documentation**: Update documentation, including this README, whenever you add or modify components to ensure clarity and ease of use.

5. **Code Standards**: Follow established code formatting and standards for readability and maintainability. Utilize tools like Prettier or ESLint as necessary.
